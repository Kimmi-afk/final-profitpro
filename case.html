      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This paper investigates the significance of pricing strategies within the scope of marketing strategies. Emphasizing its central role, the research delineates various types of pricing strategies, exploring how they can differ based on industry applications. By employing a literature review and case study methodology, we analyze the challenges faced by businesses when implementing pricing strategies, along with the potential future trends in this domain. The conclusion accentuates that, in an increasingly competitive market, businesses need to effectively craft and constantly optimize their pricing strategies in alignment with consumer behaviors, regulatory constraints, data-driven challenges, and considerations for sustainability and social responsibility. As personalization, dynamic pricing, transparency, and fairness become prevalent, businesses are offered opportunities and challenges that necessitate strategic evolution for sustained competitiveness.</p>

      <p>Nestle was founded in Switzerland by Heinrich Nestle in 1866. Nestle is one of the oldest multinational companies. From the early stages, Nestle wanted to take advantage of growth opportunities in different countries. In 1905, it merged with Anglo-Swiss condensed milk, broadening its product range to include infant formulas and condensed milk. Nestle currently has 447 factories, with operations in 189 countries.
        In this case study, we will focus on Nestle's pricing strategies. Pricing is the most important element for maximising revenues. According to Harvard studies, if there is a 1% improvement in pricing, it leads to an 11% increase in profits (approx.). If the pricing structure is incorrect, the business loses profit with each transaction made. Therefore, correct pricing is critical.
        Nestle is a multinational brand with a present net worth of about $270 billion. The success that the brand has is due to its pricing strategy. The revenue of Nestle is continuously growing, this depicts the successful identification and placement of its products in the market. Generally speaking, Nestle’s products are pricier in comparison to the products of the retailing brand.
        Nestle’s pricing strategy is fairly distinctive in contrast with other brands. It merely hinges on recognition which is attributed to the apparent quality of the product. Based on this quality and the attitude of the customers, Nestle assesses the pricing strategy it wants to implement.
